# Project3-Group1

# Objective of this Project:
Determining the recent trend in pharmaceutical spending (on prescription medicines and self-medication) by the OECD countries. 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is a unique forum where the governments of 37 democracies with market-based economies collaborate to develop policy standards to promote sustainable economic growth.

Pharmaceutical Drug Spending has been calculated as the following indicators -  

  (1) Total spending by each countries in a specific year (in millions)
  
  (2) Total spending as a percentage of the total health spending/ share of the total health spending, 
  
  (3) Total spending as a Percentage of GDP,
  
  (4) by per capita (USD) (using economy-wide PPPs)
